----OLD TEXT--- 
What is this?

The documents in this project are the compiled knowledge of how
to run a grass-roots conference. They have been pulled together
by The Perl Foundation to help us from year to year since we always
have new organizers, but they're here to help anyone.

What's the funny mark-up in the files?

These files are written in a markup language called plain old
documentation (POD) format. If you have a computer with perl on it,
you can type >perldoc YAPC.pm and read it. If you don't have
perl, you can probably just try to ignore the markup.

Questions?
