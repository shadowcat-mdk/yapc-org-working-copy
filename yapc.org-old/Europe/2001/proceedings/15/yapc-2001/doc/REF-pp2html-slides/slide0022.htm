<H1>Including nested PerlPoint sources

<P>
If the type of an included file is specified as <CODE>&quot;PP&quot;</CODE>, the file contents is made part of the presentation source.
</P>


<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80%><TR><TD bgcolor="#e5e5e5"><PRE>

  // include PerlPoint
  \INCLUDE{<B>type=pp</B> file=&quot;nested.pp&quot;}
</FONT></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>
The nesting level is umlimited, but every file <I>in a nesting hierarchy</I> is <I>read only once</I> (to avoid confusion by circular nesting). (Including the same file multiply in different nesting hierarchies is possible without problems.)
</P>


<P>
A PerlPoint file can be included wherever a tag is allowed, but sometimes it has to be arranged slightly: if you place the inclusion directive at the beginning of a new paragraph <I>and</I> your included PerlPoint starts by a paragraph of another type than text, you should begin the included file by an empty line to let the parser detect the correct paragraph type. Here is an example: if the inclusion directive is placed like
</P>


<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80%><TR><TD bgcolor="#e5e5e5"><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
  // include PerlPoint
  \INCLUDE{type=pp file=&quot;file.pp&quot;}
</FONT></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>
and <CODE>file.pp</CODE> immediately starts with a verbatim block like
</P>


<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80%><TR><TD bgcolor="#e5e5e5"><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
  &lt;&lt;VERBATIM
      verbatim
  VERBATIM
</FONT></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>
, <I>the inclusion directive already opens a new paragraph</I> which is detected to be <I>text</I> (because there is no special startup character). Now in the included file, from the parsers point of view the included PerlPoint is simply a continuation of this text, because a paragraph ends with an empty line. This trouble can be avoided by beginning such an included file by an empty line, so that its first paragraph can be detected correctly.
