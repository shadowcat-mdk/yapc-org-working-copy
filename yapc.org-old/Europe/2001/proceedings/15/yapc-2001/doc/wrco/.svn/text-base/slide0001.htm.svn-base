<P>
OK, there's this special cool multiplatform presenter software you want to use, but currently PerlPoint cannot be translated into its format. This situation can be changed - just write a PerlPoint converter. A PerlPoint converter takes a PerlPoint source and translates it into another format.

<P>
The target format can be almost everything. There's no restriction to formats used by presentation <I>software</I>. Documents can be presented in many ways: on a wall, on screen or printed, in the Web or intranet - and there are many formats out there meeting many special needs. Think of the PerlPoint converters already there: they address <I>HTML</I> (for browser presentations, online documentations, training materials, ...), <I>Clinton Pierce's Perl Projector</I> (for traditional presentations), <I>LaTex</I> (for high quality prints) and <I>SDF</I> (as an intermediate format to generate PDF, PostScript, POD, text and more easily). <I><B>Once you know the target format, you can write a PerlPoint converter to it.</B></I>

<P>
Usually, there's one converter for every target format. This is no strict rule - you may want to implement features which are not provided by an already existing <CODE>pp2anything</CODE> converter, so feel free to implement your own version. Nevertheless, to avoid confusion, it may be worth a try to cooperate with the original author before you start. Maybe you can join his team.

In this document, it is assumed that you are familiar with the PerlPoint language and its element, which is explained in ...
