<H1>5.2.2 Tags
</H1>


<P>
As mentioned above, only the general syntax of tags is part of the base language definition. The declaration of the accepted tags is almost completely the task of the author of a PerlPoint converter because tags are very converter specific. They usually reflect a feature of the target format or a special feature the converter author wants to provide.

  Hyperlinks, for example, are essential if converting
  to HTML. They can be used in PDF as well. But if you
  are writing a converter to <I>pure text</I>, they might
  be useless.

  Or: one author wants to provide footnotes, while another
  one does not.

<P>
To implement all wished tags in the parser would make the converter framework of parser and backend modules very inflexible and hard to maintain. Such an approach could end up with a huge, difficult to maintain or even unusable tag library. All tag implementation details of all converters would need to be well coordinated. So that's no real alternative.
</P>


<P>
Instead of this, PerlPoint (or its <I>base</I> definition) only defines the <I>syntax</I> of a tag (and reserves a small set of tags implementing base features like tables or image integration). <I>The definition of concrete tags, however, is a task of the several converters.</I> So a converter author is free to define all the tags he wants, and he can modify this set without changes to the framework. A definition currently includes the tag name, option and body declarations, and controls how the parser handles tag occurences. It's even possible to hook into the parsers tag processing.
</P>


<P>
Tags are defined by <I>Perl modules</I>, for a simple reason: we looked for a way to make their usage as easy as possible. And what could be easier than to write something like
</P>


<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=5 WIDTH=80%><TR><TD bgcolor="#e5e5e5"><PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">
  use PerlPoint::Tags::<B>MyFormat</B>;
</FONT></PRE></TD></TR></TABLE>


<P>
? Hardly nothing.
</P>


<P>
But there are even more advantages. Defining tags by modules provides a simple way to <I>combine</I> definitions, to publish them in a central tag repository (CPAN) and to use them in various converters. PerlPoint even offers a way to say the parser &quot;We do not implement the tags of target language SuperDooper, but please treat them as tags anywhere (we will ignore them in the backend running subsequently).&quot; - which makes it easy to process one and the same source by numerous converters defining completely different tag sets.
</P>
