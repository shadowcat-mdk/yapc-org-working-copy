<h3><a name="p5p">Perl5-porters</a></h3>
<p>Now that I got the hack of it, I seriously considered to put some more
effort in the perl5-porters movement. I was not scared away by rumours of
the list being very unfriendly and flame wars being more common than found
on other lists.</p>
<p>First thing to do is be a good listener. Don't join every discussion
you see flying by, and only respond if you know what you're talking about.
If you are sure, don't be afraid to be scared away, but always use funded
arguments to explain what you mean. Don't be surprised if it turns out that
the old members realy listen to you and see you as a serious participant in
the development of Perl.</p>
<p>I wanted to join perl5-porters to take over Ilya's position. Hmmmm. So
much for aiming too high.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why this did not happen.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I wasn't good enough</li>
  <li>I didn't have enough time for it</li>
  <li>Hugo already took that place</li>
  <li>p5p wanted me for something else</li>
  </ul>
<p>What happened is that the list somehow noticed my knowledge of shell
and awk programming (the ol' unix style commands) and that I wasn't scared
of the complexity of Perl's configuration scheme (the Configure script).</p>
<p>Eventually you'll be <i>asked</i> to help out in the (sub)field(s) where
you've proven to have knowledge of or insight in.</p>
<p>Now that Perl6 has taken a serious start, don't think perl5 doesn't need
any more attention. We do still need enthousiastic people to make perl the
language we all want, not scaring away people, but chasing away the bugs.
Start being a list-lurker tomorrow and join perl5-porters next month!</p>
<p>Look throught the TODO list to check if there is an unexplored field
left alone so far that years for your attention.</p>
