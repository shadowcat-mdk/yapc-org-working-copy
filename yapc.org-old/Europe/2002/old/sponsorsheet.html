		Sponsoring an event such as the 
			<a href="../index.html" target="_top"><b>YAPC::Europe - 2002</b></a>
		is not to be taken lightly, there are several things a potential sponsor should be aware of.
		<table><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
		Firstly this is <b>not</b> a business event of any kind.
		<br>
		<br>
		It is rather, a grassroots gathering of like-minded enthusiastic 
		 <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_top">perl</a>&nbsp; 
		 <a href="http://www.perl.com" target="_top">programmers</a> 
 		who are coming together to discuss the language of choice, share knowledge and generally soak up a bit of atmosphere.  If, along the way, the odd bit of business gets done, someone finds a job, perhaps an idea is sparked by a conversation with a peer, that turns profitable, all well and good.  This is however not the prime purpose of the event.  There is <b>no</b> promise of 'you give us <b>x</b>, we will give you <b>y</b> in return'!  Once we get this kind of <i>sales angle</i> out of the way, we should be on firmer footing.
		<br><br>
		Primarily, we hope that potential sponsors may look on our event, as a simple way of supporting the colossal, ongoing, that goes into developing and maintaining the 
		 <a href="http://www.perl.com" target="_top">perl</a> 
		 <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_top">programming</a>
		 language for free, for as long as it takes, in an <b>Open Source</b> spirit.  Many many companies reap the benefit of this free development, testing, debugging and support system that is <b>perl</b>, without ever being asked for a penny in return, and this conference is a simple way of giving something back to all those enthusiastic volunteers. 
		<br><br>
		Specifically what we do by way of acknowledgement (and it's not much):
		<ul>
		<li>In the run up to, and during, the conference, sponsors will be mentioned on our 
			<a href="sponsors.html" target="pane">sponsors</a> 
		page, with if supplied, a link to their respective home page.  
		<li>It will be noted on the 
			<a href="sponsoring.html" target="pane">sponsoring</a> 
		page, who provided what.
		<li>
		Each sponsor will be mentioned individually at the final assembly thanks, 
		<li>
		Sponsors may drop a little something in the Conference Bag, if people might find it useful.
		<li>
		There will be a poster/information wall where sponsor details can be found, during the 3 days.
		</td></tr> 
		</table>
		Finally - we hope that sponsoring this conference makes you feel good.
		<br>
		If it so happens that you recieve some direct, or indirect, benefit via 300 to 500 IT professionals, from all around the world, becoming aware of your contribution, then that would be a pleasant bonus.
